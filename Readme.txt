This is a website which took me 4 days to complete, using html and css, the layout of the website is simple, and the topography used for the
website is beige, and a little lesser opacity is used for the buttons for the 
smoother feel , so lets start with the layout of the thing. we have a sticky navbar, with my accounts linked in the form of svgs, and my name and a rounded corner for the navbar for the looks.
then i got a text, wrapped it up in a div and then centered it, added three buttons
